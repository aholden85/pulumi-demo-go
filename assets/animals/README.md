# Animal Assets

## Creating a new Animal
- The folder name for the animal must be lowercase
- The folder must contain a `facts.txt`
    - Facts must be per-line - each new fact should be on a new line
    - Facts shouldn't contain `"` characters, or any other wierdness
- The folder must contain an `images` folder
    - Image names don't matter, but be mindful of file sizes
